# SnakesAndMonopolyGame

## Project info
### In this project, We build a simple game application that is a mixture between the  Snakes & Ladders and Monopoly games. There are two modes in the game: Design mode is where  the user is able to build the playing grid and Play mode is where he plays the game itself. The general  idea of the game is four players moving in a grid having snakes, ladders, and Cards. The player goal  is to get to the last cell before anyone else. He also takes advantage of the special cells to boost his  game and obstruct his opponents. The game ends when a player reaches the last cell.
### it's basically implemented by OOP concept with C++
